1. Assume students are appearing for an exam that is starting in M hours
2. Each student gets a different exam paper and it could start at a different time from others.
3. The exam will contain questions from K lessons
4. Each lesson takes L hours to learn
5. You are given a CSV file containing many lines, each having the integers K, L, M as defined above
6. Write a scala snippet that reads this file and for each line produces an output:
    - "YES" if the student can finish preparation BEFORE the exam begins
    - "NO" if the student will not be able to finish preparation before the exam begins

Pay attention to the amount of time needed by the program to execute - try to be as optimal as possible
